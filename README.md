## Inspiration
Entire world is suffering from COVID-19. India saw a terrific second wave of COVID-19 in last few months. We lost lacs of lives and millions of us are suffering from this disease in some or the other way. Only Medicare treatment available for this virus is vaccination. Hence, I came up with the idea of building a COVID-Vaccine tracker that will help users in finding COVID-Vaccines in their districts and help India in strengthening her fight against COVID-19.

## What it does
This application tracks the Vaccines available across 500+ districts all over India. It takes basic input from user like Date, State of User and District of User. Then it tells the user about the address of vaccination centers in their district, number of available doses, name of vaccine, charges (if any) and other important information.  

## How I built it
I built this application using React JS. It uses Aarogya Setu API to fetch the required data and displays that data according to user requirements. Front-end was designed using HTML & CSS. JavaScript was also used including React JS for calling API request and displaying the results. This application is fully responsive and it takes less then 1 second to load the required information.  

## Challenges we ran into
Getting the real-time data of vaccine availability was a big issue which was later solved using Aarogya Setu API. Other small challenges were related with UI-UX interface and they were also resolved during the development.  

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
This application is very fast and completely responsive. It takes less then 1 second to load the required information for the user. It provides exact and error free information to user without any fault from server side. It's final UI-UX interface also looks awesome.  


## What I learned
I learned how to fetch API using React JS.

## What's next for JabTracker
I plan to add more features like Map based tracking for users, a voice assistant or chat bot for finding the information which will ease the process for users.

## More on COVID-19 Dashboard and Vaccination Tracker App
This is a COVID-19 Dashboard and Vaccination Tracker App. It displays COVID data such as Total Cases, Recoveries and Deaths Country wise and Visualize that using graphs. <br>
Analysis part is done using R Programming. Analysis version is hosted using Shiny R Library. <br>
Vaccination Tracker feature is built using React JS and Arogya Setu API. It provides the list of Hospitals carrying vaccination and various other details like type of vaccine (Covaxin or Covishield), Cost of Vaccine (Free or chargable), Number of doses available, etc in a City/State wise fashion. <br>
Note: Vaccine Tracker Application is ONLY for INDIAN users.<br>
Note: Both the apps are integrated (Both can be accessed from any of these links)<br>
